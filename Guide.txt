This webscraper was made to produce a live feed of the WSB daily discussion thread and scan for mentioned tickers.
The program only scans for fully capitalized tickers (eg. AAPL), not for stocks (eg. Apple).

The link of the daily discussion thread has to be manually inserted on line 45.
You can specify a starting and stopping time on line 22 and 35 respectively.
If you don't specify a correct stopping time, the program will run indefinitely, so it can be used as a live feed.

The program prints the amount of mentions per ticker in ascending order (alphabetically)
eg. (AAPL, 1),(AXX, 200), (TSLA, 5)



NOTE: program doesn't work if thread has a stickied comment!

NOTE: This is just personal practice! I will most likely make an updated version
with a proper GUI and improved functionality (increased scanning accuracy, output sorted by amount of mentions in
descending order, ...).
